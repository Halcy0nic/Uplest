# Uplest for Advanced Document Extraction

Uplest is an open-source document processing tool designed to extract valuable insights from various types of files, including PDFs, Word documents, and text files. It offers advanced features for text and image extraction, OCR, embedding generation, and metadata management.

## Key Features:

* **Extract text and images from PDFs, Word documents, and text files:** Uplest processes both structured and unstructured data in these formats, enabling you to work with comprehensive data sets.
* **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for PDF files:** Transform scanned or low-quality PDFs into searchable and editable text data.
* **Text embeddings from various file types:** Convert textual content from PDFs, Word documents, and plain text files into vector representations using state-of-the-art AI models.
* **Image captioning and embedding:** Automatically generate captions for images in your document collections using natural language processing techniques. Extract image features as embeddings for further analysis.
* **Metadata management:** Uplest adds custom metadata to your embeddings, making it easier to track the original source file of each text snippet or image.
* **Scalable storage solution:** Uplest utilizes a PostgreSQL vector database  (Pgvector) for storing and managing all generated embeddings, ensuring efficient and flexible retrieval via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications and similarity searches.
* **Integrations:** Uplest offers enhanced compatibility with various AI frameworks like Langchain, LlamaIndex, and Flowise. These frameworks can directly attach to the vector database, allowing for Relevance and Similarity (RAG) searches on the embeddings created by Uplest. By integrating Uplest into your workflow, you'll streamline your document processing tasks while unlocking new possibilities for AI-driven applications.
